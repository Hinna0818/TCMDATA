\title{Differential expression results for diabetic nephropathy (DN)}
\format{
A named numeric vector:
\describe{
\item{name}{gene symbol}
\item{value}{log2 fold change (advanced DN vs control)}
}
}
\source{
GEO dataset \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142025}{GSE142025},
analyzed using GEO2R (R 4.2.2, DESeq2 pipeline)
}
\usage{
DN_data
}
\description{
A named numeric vector of log2 fold changes derived from GSE142025,
comparing kidney transcriptomes between advanced diabetic nephropathy
(DN) patients and control individuals.
}
\details{
The differential expression analysis was performed using GEO2R
based on the raw count matrix from GSE142025, representing the
\strong{full gene set} detected in human kidney tissue.
