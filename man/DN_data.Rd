\format{
A named numeric vector:
\describe{
\item{name}{gene symbol}
\item{value}{log2 fold change (advanced DN vs control)}
}
}
\source{
GEO dataset \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142025}{GSE142025},
analyzed using GEO2R (R 4.2.2, DESeq2 pipeline)
}
\usage{
DN_data
}
\description{
A named numeric vector of log2 fold changes derived from GSE142025,
comparing kidney transcriptomes between advanced diabetic nephropathy
(DN) patients and control individuals.

The differential expression analysis was performed using GEO2R
based on the raw count matrix from GSE142025, representing the
\strong{full gene set} detected in human kidney tissue.
