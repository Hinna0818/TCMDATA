\title{Resolve arbitrary identifiers to PubChem CIDs}
\usage{
resolve_cid(x, from = c("cid", "smiles", "inchi", "inchikey", "name"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector. Values can be CIDs, SMILES, InChI, InChIKey, or names.}

\item{from}{One of \code{c("cid","smiles","inchi","inchikey","name")}.}
}
\value{
Character vector of CIDs (NA when not found).
}
\description{
Resolve user-provided identifiers (CID/SMILES/InChI/InChIKey/Name)
to PubChem Compound IDs (CIDs). For structural inputs (SMILES/InChI),
it prefers POSTing the value in the request body to avoid URL length/encoding issues,
and falls back to a GET path-style endpoint if needed.
